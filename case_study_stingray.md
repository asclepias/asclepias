Stingray has 
a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray) created in October 2015 and
five tagged GitHub [releases](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/releases) with the first issued in February 2018. 
The authors submitted a [code paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01393) to JOSS in April 2019 and after [its review](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1393) was accepted in June 2019.
There are also [four archived Zenodo versions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1490116) (plus a Concept DOI that currently points to the latest release, v0.1.3).
The Stingray code was assigned an [ASCL identifier](http://ascl.net/1608.001) in August 2016.
The code has been described in an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07681), having two versions posted in January and August 2019, 
and a corresponding [ApJ article](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab258d) published in August 2019. 


Stingray has proven instructive for testing many aspects of our Asclepias investigations into the software citation ecosystem.
